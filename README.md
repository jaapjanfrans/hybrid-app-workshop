# Workshop Hybrid App Development
## 4. Authentication using a MBAAS (firebase)
### Goals

* installing Angularfire in our app
* connecting to our backend
* Hooking up authentication

### 4.1 Installing Angularfire
AngularFire is an angular implementation of the Firebase API. Very useful for us since our app is angular and we
want to utilize firebase services.


Look up angularfire on github and install it (search for the line containing the `npm` install line, which will install both firebase and angularfire packages).
